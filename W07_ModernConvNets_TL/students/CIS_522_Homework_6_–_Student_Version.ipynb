        "For this week's reading portion, we'll have you read the [original AlexNet paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf). As you read it, be sure to notice how many features of modern state of the art networks are already present in AlexNet. For example, they use ReLU for their activation function, use data augmentation, and learning rate decay. They also foreshadow the successes and challenges of deep learning with the line \"Thus\n",
        "far, our results have improved as we have made our network larger and trained it longer but we still\n",
        "have many orders of magnitude to go in order to match the infero-temporal pathway of the human\n",
        "visual system\". \n",
        "\n",
        "A side note on the growth of compute power over time: AlexNet was trained on two Nvidia GTX 580s, which were top of the line graphics cards for their time. Their theoretical processing speed is roughly [1.6 Trillion](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-gtx-580.c270) Floating point Operations Per Second (TFLOPS). This year's iPhone graphics cards have a theoretical speed of [.8 TFLOPS](https://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/cpu-apple_a14_bionic-1693). That is to say that if you were to go back in time ten years with four iPhones, you could conduct cutting edge deep learning research with them."
