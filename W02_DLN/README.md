# Week 2 - Deep Linear Networks

## Fixes/clarifications added after initial posting
- We have clarified a few aspects in W2D1, Section 'Example: A small Compute Graph' based on the Slack discussion (mainly: use pointwise multiplication and MSE loss)
- The Airtable form for HW2 has the right pods now
- Two errors in Exercise 5 in W2D2 have been updated (either make a copy of the new worksheet or replace "preds = modelSVD(inputs, params)" with "preds = model(inputs)" and "loss = criterion(preds)" with "loss = criterion(preds, targets)")
- We made minor clarifications in quiz questions in both W2D1 and W2D2 (the questions itself didn't change, no need to resubmit if you have already answered the initial version)
