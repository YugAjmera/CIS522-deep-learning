As such, **your homeworks won't be all coding** – we want to encourage you to think about the implications of deep learning and what you as a developer, product manager, CEO, or professor (or whatever you want to be when you grow up!) can do to mitigate some of the potential negative consequences of these technologies. \n",
        "\n",
        "This means that at least part of each homework will consist of **ethical discussion questions**. While we understand that many of you prefer to do coding (and we'll do that in workbooks, some homeworks, and your final projects!), we believe that the ramifications of deep learning aren't taught enough in college, and we want you to become well-rounded individuals that not only can implement deep learning algorithms but also give educated evaluations and see when things might go wrong or need improvement from a societal perspective.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will also be fairly **lenient in grading**. Our focus is on your learning journey rather than stressing you out about perfect homeworks, and as long as we see that you put in some thought and effort, you'll receive a high mark. \n",
        "\n",

Instead, our goal in this course is to take a nuanced view into how we can build algorithms that can improve the world around us, while also recognizing the shortcomings and pitfalls of these artificial agents. \n",

If you want to (and we encourage you to!), you can watch it for free [here](https://franklin.library.upenn.edu/catalog/FRANKLIN_9977866343303681) before attempting the homework, but it is not neccessary to complete the questions.\n",
